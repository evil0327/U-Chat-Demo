# U-Chat Demo
  This is a simple chatting app for demostrating my coding ability and android knowledge. In this app, I use Firebase as backend service, and integrate with many 3rd-party libraries such as Dagger2, Rxjava2, Butterknife to make the code clean. Also using android jetpack component such as LiveData, Viewmodel, Room to implement MVVM architecture. I hope you enjoy it!
